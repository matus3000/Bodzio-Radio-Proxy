# Bodzio-Radio-Proxy

Following programm was developed during Networking course on Warsaw Univeristy. This programm has some quirks one of them is user-defined sturcture for strings. Reason for this obvious redundancy is the fact that so-called small assignment is preparation for this project and one can reuse code to save some work. However small assignment can be written only in C.

The programm utilizes poll, nonblocking sockets and pipes, signalfd for signal handling, and ioctl (to get information about networking interfaces).
